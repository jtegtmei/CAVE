Dear Manuel Guizar,

I am using your efficient subpixel registration package for my PhD thesis in neuroscience. I am developing an open-source software for detecting neuronal cells with calcium imaging and use your package for the alignment of the video. I would like to thank you for this great tool and notify you that I am using it. I know you included the free license, but anyaways, many thanks!

Regards,
Jennifer Tegtmeier
